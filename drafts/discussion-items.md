# Discussion

Please feel free to add items to this list.

## Priorities to be discussed ASAP (Next review before board meeting)
- How often do we meet?
- How do we manage the open items / the inflow of information we expect to settle?
- Should we prepare a template for board reports? What should be in it? Where to store board reports?
- Do we need a code of conduct?
- Do we have a bank account? If not, who is establishing it? (Check with Kaj)
- Who is monitoring/maintaining the treasury, should we designate a person from the board with it?
- Establish communication channel that can have a long term archived (email list, archival of discord chats etc.)
- Establish contact list of board members
- Should we maintain a blog for news around our projects? / When should we start focusing on Marketing ? (Damien : Q3 2024 with Amaru demos & Feedback on the structure of Pragma > Board + Routines + Guidelines)


## Organizational
- (Public) calendar of meetings
- How to backup our source code to keep independence from GitHub low?
- Do we support the GDPR/CCPA etc. pp. on our websites, but also for our committers?

- How to enforce DCO for projects?
- How to support CCLAs (software grants from companies)?
- Create a list of infrastructure providers/owned infrastructure
- How to reach out to projects?

## Philosophy

- How do we vote on board items?
- How do we vote on project items (only for maintainers, not for board)
- Who has a binding vote in project matters (maintainer committee versus contributors)?
- What does it mean to be an Pragma project? (Core values, such as "community over code" from the ASF)
- Do we have a Meritocracy?
- What license is the board recommending/enforcing on projects?
- How to establish an "ethics" document, that separates us from scam/meme coin etc?

## Treasury

- Where to store treasury data, as bank statements?

## Marketing

- Should we maintain a blog for news around our projects?
- How to share/distribute access to social media profiles?
- Should we designate a person to maintain/oversee the profiles?

## PRAGMA Releases

- what is release with PRAGMA quality standards?
- how and where to release?
- how to distribute signing keys?

## Incubation

- Define entry criteria for incubating projects
  - Does a community need to exist before it enters incubation?
- Define exit criteria for incubating projects (into the foundation but also for failed incubations)
