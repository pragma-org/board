## Priorities to be discussed ASAP (Next review before board meeting)

  > Asynchronous reviews of documents/open points
  
- How do we manage the open items / the inflow of information we expect to settle?
  > List of open items as input for the "open items board"
  > Use the Kanban board view to materilize the discussions (one for the official board agenda/decisions and one for the open item list status)

- How do we manage the deliverables
  > Proposal file (deliverable) - to be stored on Github
  > Reviewed during the monthly meeting
  > To be decided by the board meeting if it's receivable or not
  > Then to be communicated (Public on Github, Website article...)
  > ex: "How to do a release" "What to include in the documentation of a release" 

- Should we prepare a template for board reports? What should be in it? Where to store board reports?

## Legalese and Treasury
- Do we have a bank account? If not, who is establishing it? (Check with Kaj)
- gather, review and sign-off / amend quotes from services providers (check with Damien, he should have all quotes (Prins (IP), Wadsack (accounting), Probst Partner (corporate)
- once bank account is opened - send membership invoices to founding members
- Where to store treasury data, as bank statements? (proposal Kaj: github)
- where and when to store physical documentation? (proposal Kaj: digital first as general rule; only store if required or highly recommended; where: Probst Partner)

## Organizational
- (Public) calendar of meetings
- How to backup our source code to keep independence from GitHub low?
- Do we support the GDPR/CCPA etc. pp. on our websites, but also for our committers?

## Philosophy

- How do we vote on board items?
- How do we vote on project items (only for maintainers, not for board)
- Who has a binding vote in project matters (maintainer committee versus contributors)?
- What does it mean to be an Pragma project? (Core values, such as "community over code" from the ASF)
- Do we have a Meritocracy?
- What license is the board recommending/enforcing on projects?
- How to establish an "ethics" document, that separates us from scam/meme coin etc?

## Marketing
