## 1. Executive Summary

In Q1 2025, the Administrative Board advanced several foundational governing policies and refined board roles to provide strategic support across finance, 
branding, and legal affairs. We passed multiple PRAGMA Decision Records (PDRs), appointed a new Lead Maintainer (Aiken), and aligned around the maintainer 
committee and post-mortem practices. </p>
With preparations nearly complete for our upcoming annual General Assembly meeting, participating in Buidler Fest in 
Vietnam and Node Diversity Meetup in Paris, and the Amaru treasury proposal nearly complete, PRAGMA is entering its second quarter with operational 
clarity and growing momentum.
