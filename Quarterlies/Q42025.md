## Q4 2025 (October–December)

## 1. Executive Summary

Q4 2025 focused on consolidating PRAGMA’s governance structures and preparing the organization for scale in 2026. Key priorities included formalizing the Project Committee framework, strengthening operational coordination for open source mentorship, addressing accounting and legal continuity, and preparing General Assembly actions related to board composition and reporting.
