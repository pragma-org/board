# PRAGMA Administrative Board
### Q3 2025 Quarterly Report

## 1. Executive Summary

In Q3 2025, PRAGMA entered a period of operational consolidation and community expansion. The Administrative Board focused on reinforcing governance through new templates, clarified statutory processes, and active collaboration with ecosystem partners.</p>
The quarter began with closing legacy administrative considerations, such as PRAGMA’s potential role as an “Administrator” and participation in the Oversight Committee, and pivoted toward concrete ecosystem engagement initiatives. Beatrice Anihiri was appointed Secretary, providing additional continuity and coordination across meetings and actions.</p>
Key progress included the development of PRAGMA’s mentorship and open coding programs, the first sessions planned in collaboration with Aiken and Amaru, and preparatory steps toward the Cardano Summit and potential talks on PRAGMA governance. The Board also engaged CF Legal for review of the Probst retainer and trademark matters.</p>
With clarity on scope, growing operational maturity, and cross-organizational collaboration, PRAGMA closed Q3 with strong governance alignment and readiness for public visibility in Q4.
