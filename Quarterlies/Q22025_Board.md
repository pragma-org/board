## 1. Executive Summary

In Q2 2025, the Administrative Board strengthened PRAGMA’s foundational governance by finalizing its leadership roles, expanding its administrative ambitions, and converting General Assembly discussions into concrete initiatives. </p>
The Board hosted the General Assembly Annual meeting in Vietnam. The Board welcomed a new Independent member, Marek Mahut, after the departure of Christian Grobmeier. Christina Gianelloni was re-elected as Lead Administrator, and Kaj Seidl-Nussbaumer became the interim Board Secretary. </p>
Strategic conversations continued around PRAGMA’s emerging role as an Administrator for open source projects or on the Oversight Committee, including discussions with the Cardano Foundation and Intersect.
