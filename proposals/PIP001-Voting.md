# Proposal 001: Voting

This proposal is about how to vote at PRAGMA.

This proposal is a proposal to the board.

## Types of votes

There are three types of votes:

1. Procedural
1. Code modifications
1. Releases

## Board votes

The board can only vote on procedural questions related to the foundation.

It can veto procedural decisions and releases made by the maintainer commmittees
in extraordinary circumstances, i. e. when an addition to a maintainer committee 
endangers the reputation of the foundation or a release causes 
severe security holes or is not made according to the agreed PRAGMA release process.

Board members cannot vote on or veto code modifications.

## Maintainer Committees

Maintainers have binding votes on all types of votes for the committee they are
invited to.

Maintainers cannot veto board decisions on procedures.

## Binding votes

Board members have binding votes on boards. Others are free to vote, but their
vote is only for informal purposes and consensous seeking.

Maintainer committee members have binding votes on all matters of their projects.
Contributors, with or without write access, who were not formally invited to
the maintainer committee do not have binding votes. Their votes are only 
for informal purposes and consensous seeking.

## How to vote

A vote can be done on any medium that can be archived:

- a mailing list
- on the blockchain
- as a GitHub file

As long as there is no other infrastructure available, a vote can be done
in the form of a proposal file, that is "signed" by affected parties with 
committing their own name below that file.

## Expressions

Votes can be represented with +1 and -1.

+1 means "yes". -1 means "no".

## Votes 

### Votes on code modifications

Code modifications should usually have consensous and not require any voting.
If voting is required for a project, a single -1 vote will invalidate 
the proposal made. The proposal passes, if only +1 votes are cast.

### Votes on releases

Releases always require a vote. Majority approval is used, at least three 
maintainer committee members must vote +1.

### Votes on addition to the maintainer committee

If a maintainer committee wants to add a new person to the project,
a vote is required. The vote shall be held in private. The vote will pass
when every voting maintainer committee member is in favor.

The vote should be open for 72h.

After a succcessful vote, the board needs to be informed. Before officially inviting
the person to the maintainer committee, 48h must pass.

### Board votes

All decisions made by the board must be voted on. Majority approval is used,
at least three board members must vote +1.
